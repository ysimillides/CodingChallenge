To make the code more pythonic, the main thing I would do is use the inbuilt function from numpy 
https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/reference/generated/numpy.random.choice.html , which allows us to reduce the problem , to an already 
solved one. Furthermore I would possibly implement the randon numbers using  os.urandom() or SystemRandom as these are more 
cryptographically secure.
